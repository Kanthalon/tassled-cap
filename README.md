Code from a project that uses satellite reflectance data to identify areas of vegetation and water.

This code will not be fully functional, as it requires two particular (rather large) image files 
from a Landsat 5 satellite as well as data files output by a program called ENVI for comparison.

Some code that sought to make our results more similar to ENVI's has been removed 
to avoid potentially disclosing proprietary information.
